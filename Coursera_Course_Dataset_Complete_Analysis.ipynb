We observed that most courses are highly rated and cater primarily to beginner levels, emphasizing the accessibility of education on Coursera. Further analysis revealed weak correlations between course ratings, number of reviews, and course duration, suggesting that course quality is not solely dependent on popularity or length.\n",
